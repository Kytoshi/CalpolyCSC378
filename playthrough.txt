Gaea's Cradle
Tall old trees surround you, towering over the sky, watching over the bending path. The bending path continues north for miles ahead. To the west, among the path, you see an old shrine. Behind you is your hometown, Allune. To your right in the East, you see a long beaten trail that goes deep into the woods. You packed all you needed for your journey in your backpack.
